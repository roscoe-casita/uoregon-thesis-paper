\abstract{		This paper introduces the hypergraph traversal problem along with the known solutions: Naive, Branch and bound, and polynomial-space iteratrive. version of the algorithm. Lists instead of sets are used to define Odometers and Hypergraphs. All familiar set operations on Odometers are redefined as list operations for succinctness. Lastly future research directions are examined. }
