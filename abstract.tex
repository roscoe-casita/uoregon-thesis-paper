\abstract{This paper introduces the venacular of Odometers and their relation to hypergraphs. An odometer is simiply a list of numbers. Of particular interest is that lists are used instead of sets for definitions. The definitions of hyperedge, hypergraph, are introduced in terms of odometers and lists. The $unrestricted$ hypergraph is derived as a result of using a list instead of a set. Familiar resitions are put in place to enforce $normal$ and $simple$ hypergraphs.\\

The hypergraph traversal problem along with the following sample solutions are presented using the defintions introduced:  Naive, Branch and bound, polynomial-space iteratrive. Future research directions including distributed variations, preemptive optimization, and potentially condensing transversals themselves. \\

Lastly odometers are revisited again in the appendix to establish clearly the operations such as Union, Intersetion, etc. All of these familiar operations on sets are directly applicable to lists of nonrepeated sorted numbers.
